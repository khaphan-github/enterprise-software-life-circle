# Compare standard Software development and Enterprise Software development
| Category                   | Standard Software Development | Enterprise Software Development |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                | Meets general needs for a broad user base | Tailor-made for specific organizational processes |
| **Customization**          | Usually limited              | Highly customizable to meet precise business needs |
| **Scale**                  | Designed for individual use and simpler tasks | Designed for large businesses and complex tasks |
| **Complexity**             | Simpler and more straightforward | More complex business logic and large data volumes |
| **User base**              | Targeted towards the mass market and individual users | Targeted towards specific businesses or market niches |
| **Security**               | Standard security, usually handles less critical data | Enhanced security, handles critical business data |
| **Cost**                   | Less expensive               | More expensive |
| **Development time**       | Shorter development cycles   | Longer development cycles due to complexity |
| **Maintenance**            | Lower maintenance costs      | Higher maintenance costs |

First, we start with product discovery to validate your idea and make sure it’s both feasible and meets your needs.

Next, we move on to product design and make sure your product has a top-tier user experience (UX) before we start building the minimum viable product (MVP).

Then, we build the MVP and make sure it meets strict quality standards before we launch it.

Finally, after launch we work with you on new iterations and improvements to make your product even better.

Now, let’s discuss each step in more detail.

## Product discovery
The process of researching your markeet and validating your product idea before develop it.

Durring product discoverty you usuaally do:
- Market research
- Compeltive analysis
- User research
- Feature prioritization.

After done discoverty we will have:
- An initial set of requirements
- A Prioritized fearture set
- A const estimate
- A Delivery plan.

Product discovery outcomes:
- A Clear understanding of users's needs and pain point.
- Inital requirements and prioritized feature.
- Cost estimation and delivery plan.

Who's involved and why
- Product manager: Define prioritization and ensure the product aligns with both your business goals and user needs.

- Product designer: They do user research, user interview, create user personas. Low findlity wireframes, user jurneys.

- Solutions architect: Choose best tech stack and platform to use durring the development. Identify and mitigating feasisibilty (Giam thieu kha nang) risks and developing a delivery plan.

## Product design:
- A great design will make it more useable an signiuficantly improve its UX - This can mean the differentce between a sucessfull and failed product.
- When designing an enterprice product:
  In-depth user research
  Creating user flows
  Wireframing
  Making a mockup
  Building a prototype
  User testing
  Creating a design system
- Product design outcomes:
  - Defined UX/UI design.
  - Design system
  - Design documentation and guidelines.
- Who's involved and why
  - Product manager: Make sure it aligns with product visions and business goals.
  - Product designer: UI UX

## Software engineering
Development team will take your product requriements and design turn them into working software product.

- We need use the right development methodogy and make sure you integrate quality (QA) from the start.
- Follow coding best practices.
  + Frequent code reviews
  + Write clean and maintainable code.
  + Build CIDC pipeline
  + Version control
  + Detals documents.

This way,  your team will work more effeciently and write better code and because enterprices software hadndles bussiness-critical data, quality matters.
- Software engineerting outcomes:
  + Tested and validated software
  + Deployment-ready software
  + Technical documentation.
- Who's involved and why
  + Project manager: Oversee the software development process and make sure it stay on track, within budget, and meets deealines.
  + Software engineers: Write code and building the software according to design specifiaction and technical requirements.
  + QA engineer: Bug-fee and performs well.

## Continuus product improverments:
- Continuously improve it if you want it to be viable in the long term.
- At a minimum, weekly touchpiont with customer by the team building the product, where they're conducting small research activities in pursuit of a desired product out come.
- Outcome:
  + Regular updatees and improvements:
  + Reduced number of bugs and vulnerabilities.
  + Improvied user satifaction (Su hai long) and retention (Su duy tri).
- Who's involved and why
  + Product manager: Prioritized new features and update based on user feedback, business goals, maket trends.
  + Software enginer: Implement new features.
  + QA: Test new feature.

## Key tips for the enterprice software development process.
- Use Agile methodogies (See details)
- Prioritize security: Enterprice software handle sensitive business critical data and information and making sure it's self is an absolute must.

# Deployment:
- [] From base project structure - it can deployed to many infrastructure, only change interface, and can use many database but keep core domain logic.
- [] How this code can run in serverless, what new need config.
# Monitoring:
# Bernchmark:
# Logging:
# Documentation:
- npm publish --access public
